# character_viewer

A simple app to view characters from the Simpsons and The Wire characters.

## Getting Started

1. Have either a physical or tablet device or emulator/simulator running.
2. Two ways, you can run the app:
    1. Run `./run-simpsons.sh` or `./run-thewire.sh` in the terminal from root of the project. Please make sure they are executable by running `chmod +x run-simpsons.sh` or `chmod +x run-thewire.sh` if they are not.
    2. Open the project in Android Studio and run the app from there by choosing 'Simpson' or 'TheWire' from the configuration dropdown menu.
3. Enjoy!
